When the game prompts "Player X, enter your move (row column):", the expected response should be two numbers separated by a space. Here's how to interpret and respond to this prompt:

The first number represents the row (1, 2, or 3)
The second number represents the column (1, 2, or 3)

Valid responses would be:
"1 1" for the top-left corner
"2 2" for the center
"3 3" for the bottom-right corner

Here's a visual representation of how the numbers correspond to the board:

1 1 | 1 2 | 1 3
-----------------
 2 1 | 2 2 | 2 3
-----------------
 3 1 | 3 2 | 3 3

So, for example:

To place your marker in the top-right corner, you would enter: "1 3"
For the middle-left position, you would enter: "2 1"
For the bottom-center position, you would enter: "3 2"

Remember:

You must enter two numbers separated by a space.
Both numbers should be 1, 2, or 3.
You can only choose an empty space on the board.

If you enter an invalid move (like a position that's already taken or numbers out of range), the game will tell you it's an invalid move and ask you to try again.
